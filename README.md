**Project Name**: Algorithm Visualizer and Executor

### Project Overview

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based tool designed to demonstrate the execution of various well-known algorithms in computer science. The primary goal of the project is to help users visualize and understand the step-by-step execution of algorithms through interactive UI elements.

The tool is built using Python and Tkinter for the GUI, and it allows users to choose from a list of classic algorithms, input relevant data, and view the results of each algorithm's computation.

### Features and Algorithms

This project includes implementations of the following algorithms:

1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
2. **Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS)**: Determines the shortest sequence that contains both input sequences as subsequences.
3. **Levenshtein Distance**: Calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into another.
4. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence where the elements are in strictly increasing order.
5. **Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)**: Solves the problem of determining the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.
6. **0-1 Knapsack Problem**: Determines the maximum value of items that can be placed in a knapsack of a given capacity.
7. **Partition Problem**: Determines whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
8. **Rod Cutting**: Solves the problem of cutting a rod into pieces to maximize profit based on its length.
9. **Coin Change Problem**: Determines the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coin denominations.
10. **Word Break Problem**: Determines whether a given string can be segmented into valid words from a dictionary.

Each algorithm can be selected via a GUI where the user can input sample data and see the result, including visualizing the results of their computation.

### Key Features of the Project:
- **Interactive GUI**: Users can select different algorithms and input their own test cases or use sample ones.
- **Detailed Results**: After selecting an algorithm and inputting the necessary data, users can view the input and output in a separate window.
- **Efficient Execution**: The algorithms are implemented efficiently and can handle various sizes of input data.
- **Modular Code**: The project is organized into separate algorithm files for easier maintenance and expansion. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function in its own file.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The project is implemented in Python, making use of Python’s simplicity and rich library support.
- **Tkinter**: The project uses Tkinter, a popular Python library for creating desktop applications, to build the GUI.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of various classic algorithms in computer science are written from scratch in Python.

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install any necessary libraries (e.g., Tkinter) if not already available.
4. Run the `main.py` file to start the application.

### Example Usage
- Upon running the project, users can select an algorithm like "Longest Common Subsequence" from the main window.
- After selection, users will be prompted to input strings for LCS computation, and the output will be displayed in a new window showing the result of the LCS algorithm.
- Similarly, users can run other algorithms by selecting them from the interface.

### Suggested Repository Name:
- `algorithm-visualizer-tkinter`

### Conclusion
This project is an educational tool designed to provide a visual representation of classic algorithms. By allowing users to interact with these algorithms and view their results in real time, the project aims to make learning about algorithms more accessible and engaging.
